\subsection{Significance of the study}

The proposed AIoT navigation hat has the potential to escalate the performance of existing assistive devices by:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Enhancing independence and mobility
    \item Improving cognitive comfort and ease of use
    \item Bridging physical and digital accessibility participation
    \item Promoting Social Inclusion and Employment Opportunities for the VIP
\end{enumerate}
In addition, this system innovates the research for Assistive Technology.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item VIP can navigate safely and confidently with less assistance through audio cues generated by the device.
    \item The system simplifies understanding spatial information, reducing mental strain (cognitive overload) and allowing quick interpretation without long training
    \item With AIoT integration, users can access navigation apps and online services hands-free using voice or gesture commands
    \item As VIP gain independence, they can engage more in education, work, and community activities, boosting their self-esteem and reducing reliance on others
\end{enumerate}
The project's success may inspire further studies on brain-inspired computing and wearable assistive devices, paving the way for more innovative tools. This project device will specifically benefit to the following:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Visually Impaired and Blind Individuals} - They are the primary beneficiaries, gaining increased mobility, safety, and access to digital and social spaces through sensory substitution and IoT assistance.
    \item \textbf{Families and Caregivers} - With the device promoting user independence, caregivers will experience reduced physical and emotional strain while maintaining peace of mind about the user's safety.
    %\item \textbf{Educators and Accessibility Advocates} - Teachers and advocates working with visually impaired students can integrate the technology into learning environments to enhance inclusivity and accessibility. Such as allowing them to access resources and infrastructure that did not take the visually impaired into account (Sites, Media, etc.)
    \item \textbf{Medical and Rehabilitation Specialists} - Eye health professionals and rehabilitation centers can use the system as a tool for sensory training and mobility rehabilitation programs, especially in fill in aspects the patent lacks or have trouble with.
    \item \textbf{Researchers and Engineers in Assistive Technology} - The project offers a novel framework that combines virtual world modeling, IoT, and sensory emulation, providing a foundation for future innovations in human-computer interaction and embedded systems.
    \item \textbf{Government and NGOs for Disability Support} - Organizations involved in disability welfare can adopt or fund similar low-cost solutions to support national accessibility programs and meet inclusive development goals.
