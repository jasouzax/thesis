\subsection{Research Design/Methods}

This research implements an experimental and iterative prototyping research focused on developing and testing the wearable AIoT-based visual sensory substition device. This is done by following a development methodology which is similar to the engineering design cycle as seen in figure \ref{fig:researchcycle}.
