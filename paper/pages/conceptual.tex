Figure \ref{fig:conceptual} states the conceptual framework of our research in a form of an Input-Process-Output (IPO) model. We start with three kinds of required input such has Hardware for our Microcontroller, Sensors, Actuators, and SIM Module, Software for our Project management, Client-side device, and Server-side device, and the Wireless Connectivity used in our device which can be either 2/3G which is used on deployment doors, or Wi-Fi which is used deployment indoors or development. Our method of research mimics typical development cycle with addition to literature review and research, such has literature review, prototyping, designing, etc. By the end of each iterative development we are to expect to be closer to the end goal, with a feedback from either advisor or mentor to start the cycle again until our end goal of an wearable navigation aid is developed.
