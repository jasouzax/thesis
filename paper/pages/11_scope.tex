\subsection{Scope and Delimitation}

The research focuses on Sensory Substitution Devices, more specifically on Vision Substitution. Our device aims to fill in what different variety of visually impaired individuals lacks, like if fully blind our device should be able to act as an artificial eye providing information the person wants, or if the person is near sighted it could read text from afar from the user and warn of objects rapidly approaching the user, and so on. It does this by having a modular system running the main pipeline, the main pipeline inputs images from the stereo camera, creates a point cloud, maps it to a virtual physical map, follows an algorithm to emulate human vision processes, and finally generate the necessary audio cues for the individual. This pipeline allows applications to take into account more varied needs such has hand gesture recognition to control the parameters of the main pipeline so the person can navigate the device without seeing anything, image recognition to read text near or far, face recognition to recognize friends and family, and even more personalized interest like keeping track of expenses.

%This research is conducted in the University of San Agustin and thus the prototype is initially to be tested by the researchers who only half of them are little bit near sighted, our testing sample is to soon include members of Iloilo blind associations such as the Association of Disabled Persons - Iloilo Inc. The main pipeline is prioritized over other features has it is the central component and partially answers the research question of solving existing sensory substitution issues. Has a result our prototype doesn't take into much consideration the much varied range of visual imparities, and since our study prioritize the main function over the physical design, the prototype would be heavier than what it could be if optimized for weight. However, our main objective is to build the main pipeline and the capability of support applications anywhere in the pipeline (modular operating system) showing it is possible that some of the issues facing most sensory substitution devices could be solved.
