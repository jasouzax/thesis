\subsection{Research Design/Methods}

This research follows a mixed method design in data collection such as using quantitative data in measuring the accuracy and speed of the device in conveying information, and qualitative data in measuring the comfortability and acclimation of users towards using the device.


% This research implements an experimental and iterative prototyping research focused on developing and testing the wearable AIoT-based visual sensory substition device. This is done by following a development methodology which is similar to the engineering design cycle as seen in figure \ref{fig:researchcycle}.
