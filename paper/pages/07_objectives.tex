%Objectives of our study

\subsection{General Objective}
To develop an AIoT visual sensory substitution hat device that converts real-time environment information through emulating human sensory processes into audio cues for the visually impaired people (VIP)

\subsection{Specific Objectives}
\begin{enumerate}
    % Software
    \item To develop the main pipeline to represent environmental information to audio cues
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Working photogrammetry (2D to 3D) system from the cameras
        \item Uses help from the IMU to create a virtual environment
        \item Toggable modes to prioritize what information is cued into audio
        \item Allows insertion anywhere in the pipeline for more custom preferences
    \end{enumerate}
    % Hardware
    \item To develop the device to be portable and comfortable
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Uses battery instead of needing direct connection to power
        \item Can be charged through UPS instead of disposable batteries
        \item All packed into a hat to avoid putting strain on sensitive areas like eyes, nose, and ears
    \end{enumerate}
    % AI Testing
    \item To test the accuracy and speed of the AI models
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Determine the frames per seconds of AI or Image processes
        \item Compare depth predictions with actual depth
        \item Failure cases of Language Models fullfilling request
    \end{enumerate}
    % User/Device Evaluation
    \item To evaluate the user's comfort and acclimation towards the device
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Does the device become uncomfortable during long periods of usage?
        \item Does the main pipeline become subconscious to the user's experience?
        \item Can the user properly interpret information the device is providing them?
    \end{enumerate}


    % !User experience
    % \item To develop an interface that is not visually dependent nor over stimulating
    % \begin{enumerate}
    %     \item Command and instructions are derived from hand guestures through hand recognition
    %     \item The commands and instructions are easy to understand and navigate
    %     \item The audio output is controlled minimizing unessary information
    % \end{enumerate}
    % !Testing
    % \item To test if users develop unsubconscious visual senses of the environment
    % \begin{enumerate}
    %     \item They can navigate indoor through rooms/doors/furnitures
    %     \item They can detect movement and even catch trown objects
    % \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
