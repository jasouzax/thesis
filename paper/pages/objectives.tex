\subsection{General Objective}
To develop an AIoT visual sensory substitution hat device that converts real-time environment information through emulating human sensory processes into audio cues for the visually impaired people (VIP)

\subsection{Specific Objectives}
\begin{enumerate}
    % Software
    \item To develop the main pipeline to represent environmental information to audio cues
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Working photogrammetry (2D to 3D) system from the cameras
        \item Uses help from the IMU to create a virtual environment
        \item Toggable modes to prioritize what information is cued into audio
        \item Allows insertion anywhere in the pipeline for more custom preferences
    \end{enumerate}
    % Hardware
    \item To develop the device to be portable and comfortable
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Uses battery instead of needing direct connection to power
        \item Can be charged through UPS instead of disposable batteries
        \item All packed into a hat to avoid putting strain on sensitive areas like eyes, nose, and ears
    \end{enumerate}
    % User experience
    \item To develop an interface that is not visually dependent nor over stimulating
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Command and instructions are derived from hand guestures through hand recognition
        \item The commands and instructions are easy to understand and navigate
        \item The audio output is controlled minimizing unessary information
    \end{enumerate}
    % Testing
    \item To test if users develop unsubconscious visual senses of the environment
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item They can navigate indoor through rooms/doors/furnitures
        \item They can detect movement and even catch trown objects
    \end{enumerate}

    % \item To develop a working photogrammetry (2D to 3D) system that:
    % \begin{enumerate}
    %     \item Creates a depth map based on the stereo camera
    %     \item Transforms it into a point cloud projection
    %     \item Matches the point cloud project to existing virtual map with help from IMU
    %     \item Can include additional information such as color and movement
    % \end{enumerate}
    % \item To develop a system of representing environmental information though audio cues that:
    % \begin{enumerate}
    %     \item Includes different modes of representing audio based on human sensory processes
    %     \item Each mode prioritizes a specific aspect of the environment compromising other aspects
    %     \item The modes can transition from one mode to another
    % \end{enumerate}
    % \item To develop the modular operating system such that:
    % \begin{enumerate}
    %     \item Features can be added as applications even if the prototype only includes the core features
    %     \item Integrate these application with the central pipeline from visual to audio information
    %     \item Add one application that recognizes hand guestures and interpret it has instructions to navigate the system
    % \end{enumerate}
    % \item To develop an AIoT server that:
    % \begin{enumerate}
    %     \item Keep tracks of users' information such has location, credentials, etc.
    %     \item Uses that information to process API requests for the users
    %     \item API methods can include accessing other APIs like Google maps, or towards AI like Language Models
    % \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
