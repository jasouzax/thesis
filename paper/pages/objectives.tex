Objectives of our study

\subsection{General Objective}
To develop an AIoT visual sensory substitution hat device that converts real-time environment information through emulating human sensory processes into audio cues for the visually impaired people (VIP)

\subsection{Specific Objectives}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item To develop a working photogrammetry (2D to 3D) system that:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Creates a depth map based on the stereo camera
        \item Transforms it into a point cloud projection
        \item Matches the point cloud project to existing virtual map with help from IMU
        \item Can include additional information such as color and movement
    \end{enumerate}
    \item To develop a system of representing environmental information though audio cues that:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Includes different modes of representing audio based on human sensory processes
        \item Each mode prioritizes a specific aspect of the environment compromising other aspects
        \item The modes can transition from one mode to another
    \end{enumerate}
    \item To develop the modular operating system such that:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Features can be added as applications even if the prototype only includes the core features
        \item Integrate these application with the central pipeline from visual to audio information
        \item Add one application that recognizes hand guestures and interpret it has instructions to navigate the system
    \end{enumerate}
    \item To develop an AIoT server that:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Keep tracks of users' information such has location, credentials, etc.
        \item Uses that information to process API requests for the users
        \item API methods can include accessing other APIs like Google maps, or towards AI like Language Models
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
