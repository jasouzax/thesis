                <h2>Background of the Study</h2>
                <p>
                    Visual impairment is a global health problem that significantly affects individual’s daily lives by impeding independent navigation, social interaction, and overall quality of life. 
                    There is an estimation of 2.2 billion people globally who are identified as visually impaired and this number could still increase to 2.5 billion by 2050 as stated by the World Health Organization. 
                    In the Philippines, 2.17 million Filipinos are identified as visually impaired.

                    <h3>Classification of Visual Impairment</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Mild Vision Impairment:</strong> visual acuity is better than 6/18</li>
                        <li><strong>Moderate Vision Impairment:</strong> visual acuity is worse than 6/18 but better than 6/60</li>
                        <li><strong>Severe Vision Impairment:</strong> visual acuity is worse than 6/60 but better than 3/60</li>
                        <li><strong>Blindness:</strong> visual acuity is worse than 3/60</li>

                <h2>Rationale</h2>
                <p>
                    Existing devices often perform poorly in real-world situations, encountering cognitive overload problems that overwhelm users with excessive information. 
                    Many designs are bulky, uncomfortable, or require extensive training. 
                    This study aims to address these matters through the development of a wearable navigation hat integrated with AIoT, 
                    introducing a smart navigation system that uses 3D point cloud data to give audio feedback and connects to IoT services.

                <h2>General Objective</h2>
                <p class="objective-statement">
                    To develop an AIoT visual sensory substitution hat device that converts real-time environment information 
                    through emulating human sensory processes into audio cues for the visually impaired people (VIP).
                </p>
                
                <h3>Specific Objectives</h3>
                <ul class="check-list">
                    <li>Develop the main pipeline to represent environmental information to audio cues (Photogrammetry, IMU integration).</li>
                    <li>Develop the device to be portable and comfortable (Battery powered, Hat form factor).</li>
                    <li>Test the accuracy and speed of the AI models.</li>
                    <li>Evaluate the user’s comfort and acclimation towards the device.</li>
