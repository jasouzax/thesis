The connection between the Orange Pi Zero 2W and the Orange Pi Expansion Board is established via a single flexible ribbon cable, connecting their respective 24-pin interfaces.

The Orange Pi Zero 2W is connected to the Expansion Board using a 24-pin Flexible Printed Circuit (FPC) ribbon cable. This cable interfaces directly with the corresponding 24-Pin receptacles on both devices.

Functionality

1. Signal Extension: The 24-pin connection relays all critical signals, including power lines, GPIO control signals, I2C, SPI, and UART buses, from the Orange Pi Zero 2W's central processor to the Expansion Board.
2. Peripheral Access: The Expansion Board extends the functionality of the compact Orange Pi Zero 2W by providing access to standard external interfaces such as full-sized USB ports, an RJ45 Ethernet jack, and an audio jack.
