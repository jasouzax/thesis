The MPU6050 Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) module is connected to the Orange Pi Zero 2W using the Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) serial communication interface. This connection uses four wires routed directly through the Orange Pi's General-Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) header.

I2C Communication Lines

The I2C protocol enables data exchange between the master (Orange Pi) and the slave (MPU6050) using two signal lines:

Serial Clock (SCL): The Black wire connects the SCL pin on the MPU6050 module to the designated I2C Clock pin on the Orange Pi's GPIO header. This synchronizes the data transfer.

Serial Data (SDA): The Blue wire connects the SDA pin on the MPU6050 module to the designated I2C Data pin on the Orange Pi's GPIO header. This line carries the data packets.

Power Supply and Ground

The power connections ensure the sensor operates correctly:

Power (VCC): The Red wire connects the VCC pin on the MPU6050 module to the 3.3V pin on the Orange Pi's GPIO header, supplying the necessary operating voltage.

Ground (GND): The Black wire connects the GND pin on the MPU6050 module to a common GND pin on the Orange Pi's GPIO header, establishing the electrical reference.

This configuration allows the Orange Pi Zero 2W to read real-time motion and orientation data (accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer) from the MPU6050 for system operation and processing.
