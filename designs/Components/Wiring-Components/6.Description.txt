The system connects two OV5640 Camera Modules to the Orange Pi Expansion Board using a chain of components.

Dual Camera Connection via Expansion Board

1.  Camera to Bridge: The two OV5640 Camera Modules are connected via a Digital Video Port (DVP) interface to a 2 x DVP to USB Bridge board.
2.  Bridge to Expansion Board: The USB output from the Bridge board is connected via a ribbon cable to one of the 2 x USB ports on the Orange Pi Expansion Board.
3.  Data Flow: The Expansion Board, which is connected to the Orange Pi Zero 2W via a 24-pin FPC cable, acts as a hub. The USB data stream (containing video from both cameras) flows from the bridge board through the Expansion Board's USB interface and then into the Orange Pi Zero 2W for processing.

This configuration allows the Orange Pi Zero 2W to receive and process dual OV5640 camera feeds via its extended USB interface for applications requiring stereo vision or multiple viewing angles.
