This diagram illustrates the wired connection between the SIM868 GSM/GPRS/GNSS module and the Orange Pi Zero 2W, utilizing the Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART) interface for serial communication, along with dedicated lines for power and system control. All physical connections are made through the General-Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) header of the Orange Pi Zero 2W.

Serial Communication (UART)
The primary four communication lines enable the Orange Pi Zero 2W to send AT commands and receive data from the SIM868 module:

SIM868 RXD to Orange Pi TXD: A Blue wire connects the SIM868's Receive Data (RXD) pin to a dedicated Transmit Data (TXD) pin on the Orange Pi's GPIO header.

SIM868 TXD to Orange Pi RXD: A Blue wire connects the SIM868's Transmit Data (TXD) pin to a dedicated Receive Data (RXD) pin on the Orange Pi's GPIO header.

SIM868 RTS to Orange Pi CTS: A Blue wire connects the SIM868's RTS (Request to Send) pin to the corresponding CTS (Clear to Send) pin on the Orange Pi.

SIM868 CTS to Orange Pi RTS: A Blue wire connects the SIM868's CTS pin to the corresponding RTS pin on the Orange Pi. These four lines collectively form the UART interface, including Hardware Flow Control (RTS/CTS) to ensure reliable data transfer.

Power and System Control
Power Input (V_IN): The Red wire connects the SIM868's V_IN pin to the 5V pin on the Orange Pi's GPIO header, providing the required operating voltage.

Ground (GND): The Black wire connects the SIM868's GND pin to a GND pin on the Orange Pi's GPIO header, establishing the necessary common electrical reference.

System Control (DTR): The Orange/Red wire connects the SIM868's DTR (Data Terminal Ready) pin to a designated GPIO pin on the Orange Pi. This connection is typically used for sleep/wake control or monitoring module status.

This comprehensive configuration enables the Orange Pi Zero 2W to leverage the SIM868 module for external communication services (cellular networking and GPS), making the single-board computer a mobile data platform.
