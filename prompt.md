With this incomplete paper template I have to restart with a new template, please rewrite this paper to (with citations):



* **Background of the Study** - Please bring up the statistics of the visually impared by types *(fully blind, near sighted, far sighted, etc.)* and by place *(globally, philippines, and in Iloilo if possible)*. Explain what visual sensory substitution devices are and how it could help the visually impared, their reasons why they arent globally used by the visually impared *(e.g: cognitive overload, training and intuitiveness, ergonomics, processing constrains of sensory systems, etc. but summarized has it will be mostly in Rationale)*. Our attempts to solve it through three major solution in the attached document *(Not that specific cause most will be in Rationale)*, and our final objective to foward the process of Sensory Substitution Device and attempt to see if we could overcome the issues they faced in societal wide implementation
* **Rationale** - In here explain in full detail the existing issues or knowledge gap in Sensory Substitution Devices mostly specifically in Visual Substitution, and how solving this issues would greately improve the lives of the Visually impared people especially the fully blind has it would help them navigate the Physical and Digital worlds. And here fully specify the solutions we implemented that seperates us from existing research papers.
* **Objectives of the Study**

  * **General Objective** - Here just specify our generate objective I provided in the paper template, the objective to build the Visual sensory substitution device through our methods
  * **Specific Objectives** - Here specify our two specific objectives I also provided in the paper template of the Physical World and the Digital World

* **Significance of the Study** - Here explain issues the visually impared especially the blind face in navigating the physical and digital world, especially in the Philippines. Specify what solutions have been made for them like Mobility aids, Digital Accessibility Tools, etc. But explain the remaining issues like Public implementation *(Our device converts visual information to audio such that when society doesnt fully support braille or blind support our device could translate nessary information ensuring the blind doesnt fully depend on blind support)*, Cost *(Our device should be cheaper then the phone has it is ment to be the Blind's man phone)*, Inconsistent implementations in WCAG/ADA *(Our application uses automation/APIs to interact with external sources reducing dependencies of the blind in blind support websites/apps, etc.)*
* **Conceptual Framework** - I am not sure what this should be about, but our device's variables include images from the two cameras, depth and color information from applying stero computations with the two cameras *(5MP 160deg, 10cm apart)*, audio data from the speaker, user orientation from the IMU, the point cloud output from the computation is then scalled and map to a virutal digital map, nessary information is either directly outputed to speaker like voice information or processed as a spectrogram like depth information (frequency represents Y-axis, binaural audio represents X-axis, volume represents depth or Z-axis, focus point is located at the center of the image infront of user, focus radius is inversely proportional to focus point change speed which is mostly biased on the X-axis has objects near the top or bottom of the user is more important thus the focus shape is more of a tall oval, etc. variables should match human visual/sensory theories like logarithmic scalling or focus scopping, etc)
* **Theoretical Framework** - I am also not sure what this should be about, but our research is based on the theory of human cognitive senses like logarithmic scalling or focusing scopping, but also theorizes that by prioritizing emulating human cognitive processes/illusions/etc. we could solve (Sensory Substitution Devices)SSD's problem of sensory overload or fautigue, and could also solve different generalized situtations by making the underlying system modular for the user's personal interest/wants
* **Scope and Delimitations** - Include what was stated in the paper, our research specifically focusing on creating a visual sensory substitution device so we must prioritize on ensuring that the visual information can be interpreted through audio, then we can focus on ensuring the underlying system is modular for more processes the user wants and that the device could keep track of the physical and digital world
