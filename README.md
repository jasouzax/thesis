### Summary
1. **Identifying a Problem**  
   The thesis identifies a problem aligned with global frameworks, such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), to ensure relevance and real-world impact. Specifically, it focuses on **SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities**, which targets disparities based on factors like income, age, sex, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, religion, or economic status. To narrow the scope, the work concentrates on **disability inequalities, with an emphasis on visual impairments** (e.g., blindness or low vision, affecting over 2.2 billion people per WHO estimates).

2. **Identifying the Objective**  
   Drawing from SDG 10, the primary objective is to **minimize inequalities faced by visually impaired individuals**. These fall into two major, often overlapping categories:  
   - **Navigational inequalities**: Barriers in physical and digital infrastructure not designed for accessibility (e.g., buildings without tactile guides or websites lacking audio alternatives).  
   - **Social inequalities**: Limitations in communication, societal status, or workforce participation (e.g., reduced job opportunities due to inaccessible tools or stigma in social interactions).  
   Note that inequalities are not strictly binary; for instance, job opportunities can involve both navigational challenges (e.g., vision-dependent tasks) and social ramifications (e.g., financial limitations from restricted options), aligning with SDG targets like 10.1 (reducing income inequalities through broader employment access), 10.2 (promoting social, economic, and political inclusion), and 10.3 (ensuring equal opportunities despite barriers like discrimination).

3. **Identifying a Solution**  
   Approaches to addressing these inequalities are not mutually exclusive and can blend elements, though they often prioritize one aspect:  
   - **Assistive technologies**, which primarily extend existing capabilities (e.g., canes, guide dogs, or braille displays).  
   - **Substitution technologies**, which primarily represent missing senses through alternatives (e.g., screen readers or sensory substitution devices that convert visual data to audio/tactile feedback).  
   The thesis prioritizes the **substitution approach** due to its potential for comprehensive impact on the identified objectives, enabling more independent navigation and interaction, while acknowledging that hybrid solutions may incorporate assistive elements.

4. **Identifying the Issues**  
   Substitution technologies, particularly sensory substitution devices (SSDs), encounter significant, interconnected challenges generalized as **sensory limitations**:  
   - **Sensory overload**: When translated information exceeds the brain's processing capacity.  
   - **Sensory fatigue**: Prolonged use leading to mental exhaustion.  
   - **Sensory integration**: Difficulty in learning or subconsciously interpreting the substituted signals.  
   These stem from the core limitation of representing one sense through another and must be addressed for effective adoption.

5. **Identifying our Hypothesis**  
   Inspired by human psychology—where perception is **selective rather than raw data intake**—the hypothesis posits that SSDs can minimize sensory limitations by making the process **controllable**. This allows the brain to build subconscious patterns efficiently. For the prototype, users could control the "focus" of emulated vision via **silent, quick inputs like hand gestures**, mimicking eye muscle adjustments. However, the core focus is on controllability itself, with the method being modular (e.g., adaptable to voice, head tilts, or eye-tracking for users with varying abilities) to suit the hypothesis without restricting to one input type.

6. **Identifying the Tests**  
   To validate the hypothesis, evaluate the device's efficiency in mitigating sensory limitations through a mix of quantitative and qualitative metrics:  
   - **Sensory overload**: Measure user accuracy in interpreting generated audio cues (e.g., via task completion rates) and qualitative feedback on perceived overload.  
   - **Sensory fatigue**: Assess usage duration before symptoms like headaches emerge (e.g., via self-reported scales, physiological monitoring, or user surveys).  
   - **Sensory integration**: Track reaction times to environmental data, learning curves over sessions, and survey responses on ease of subconscious adaptation.  
   - **Device performance**: Test accuracy in recognizing user controls (e.g., hand gestures) and generating relevant audio from environmental inputs.  
   Evaluations will include comparisons to baselines from related literature on existing SSDs, incorporating user-centered qualitative insights (e.g., surveys) to account for individual experiences.

7. **Identifying the Impact**  
   If successful, the device could substitute visual information as audio via a **modular pipeline**, enabling extensions for diverse needs (e.g., customizable adaptations for varying lifestyles or impairment levels). This would reduce navigational inequalities (e.g., accessible OS and environments for better job opportunities) and social inequalities (e.g., enhanced communication tools), contributing to SDG 10 targets such as 10.1 (income growth via expanded employment), 10.2 (empowerment through regained navigational and social inclusion), and 10.3 (equal opportunities in workforce and society). While not resolving all issues (e.g., medical treatments or systemic discrimination), it demonstrates the possibility of partially minimizing sensory limitations—evidenced by test results showing users can interpret data with reduced overload, fatigue, or integration challenges—paving the way for applications to other sensory disabilities.

8. **Identifying the Scope and Limitations**  
   The thesis prioritizes proving the hypothesis—that sensory limitations can be partially addressed through selective, controllable substitution—rather than perfecting the device or developing all extensions. By completion, the output will be a prototype SSD that emulates visual perception as audio, minimizes limitations, and features a modular pipeline for future enhancements (e.g., alternative controls). Limitations include assumptions of basic user abilities for prototype inputs, focus on visual-to-audio substitution only, and recognition that tech complements broader efforts like policy changes for full inequality reduction.

## Summary
- [**Problem**](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5044782) - Issue facing visual sensory substitution devices in widespread adoption that being **cognitive overload** and **limited generaliziblity**.
- **Solution** - To **emulate human visual attention** to solve cognitive overload, and to implement a **virtual navigatable world system** to solve limited generaliziblity.
- **Hypothesis** - Would emulating *human visual processes* to minimize substituted information and implementing *navigation techniques to virtual worlds (physical and digital)* prevent cognitive overload, allow subconscious sensory augmentation, and help integrate visually impared individuals in the physical and digital aspects?
   - [**Null Hypothesis**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_hypothesis) $H_0$ - The solution we implemented provided did not prevent cognitive overload nor help individuals navigate both physical and digital worlds.
   - **Alternative Hypothesis** $H_1$ - The solution we implemented forwarded the progress of sensory substitution devices by solving the two issues facing most sensory substitution devices.
   - **P-Value Testing** - Quantitative testing such has accuracy of individual's pointing to direction of movement, and Qualitative testing (Focus Group Discussion (FGD)) such as how much of them sense through the device subconsciously.

## Title
> World Navigation Hat - Development of a Wearable Navigation Aid using AIoT for the Visually Impaired
<details>
   <summary><a href="https://www.thesavvyscientist.com/thesis-title-examples">Target</a></summary>
   
   - **Make it descriptive of the research so it’s immediately obvious what it is about!** - It's a visual sensory substitution device but not much people understand what that means so just use **"Wearable Navigation Aid"**, and although the main feature is it's visual substitution mostly use full for the full blind, it additionally incorporates other visual independent assists which can be useful for people with a variety of visual impairments thus use **"Visually Impaired"**
   - **Don’t get lost in the detail** - Our device incorporates multiple methods to achieve the goal such as manual algorithms *(world mapping, emulating senses, priority audio cueing, etc.)*, artificial intellegence *(hand gesture recognition, voice recognition, face recognition, etc.)*, and IoT *(central server for API and automation, world tracking through sensors like GPS, IMU, etc.)*. To summarize the whole process we will just use **"AIoT"** to summerize/generalize the whole process
   - **The title should tie together the chapters of your thesis** - The thesis will primarly be about the creation and testing of this device thus use **"Development"**, however since our thesis is a prototype mainly focusing on the hardware and software aspect to solve the issue the final prototype will be bulky to be worn has an eyewear so the paper will be taking into account the device has a hat instead to put all of that load in the head instead of sensitive areas like eyes and ears, thus use **"Hat"**
   - **Be strategic** - The main feature of our thesis, is to solve the inequality the visually impared faces when they participate in society, such has navigating the physical world *(going from one place to another especially if the infastructure is not designed for them in mind)*, and the digital world *(social media, internet, etc.)* thus use **"World Navigation"**

## Background of the Study
### Targets *([ref](https://www.enago.com/academy/what-is-background-in-a-research-paper))*
1. **Provide background information** - The background of the study must contain the following to provide enough background information on what this paper will be talking about
   - Provide the statistical information about the number of people affected with the variety of visual impairments in a global, national, and regional scale
   - Provide the description of what a Sensory Substitution Device are in helping the visually impared and they current issue
1. **Identify Your Audience** - Our audience in reading the paper includes students, teachers, and reviewers so we will discuss the project in technical detail
2. **Understand the Research Problem** - The research aims to solve the issues faced by current Sensory Substitution Devices primarily Cognitive overload and limited gneralization beyond labs
3. **Review Existing Literature** - Existing literature
4. **Include Historical Data**
5. **Identify Controversies and Gaps**
6. **Select Key Components**
7. **Craft a Logical Flow**
8. **Hightlight the Novelty of Your Research**

## Rationale
Our approach is justified to forward the progress of sensory substitution devices and attempt to see if we could overcome the issues they faced in societal wide implementation. Our unique approach is to implement three major solutions with a design decision:
- **Virtual worlds** that keep track of the Physical and Digital world allowing the user to navigate not just the physical world but the internet, social media, offline files, etc.
- **Emulation of Human Sensory Processes** to create a more intuitive and less cognitive overloading or sensory fatigue system for users to view the world in
- ***Modularity system** connected into a IoT server, has there are different kinds of visual impairments and everyone have different needs or preferences thus the system must allow customization for each individual which is done through the implementation of Applications
- **Hat** has a prototype is bound to be bulky which can be temporarily solved by putting weight on the head rather then more sensitive areas like eyes or ears until we could compress it into an eyewear
