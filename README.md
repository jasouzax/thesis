## Title
> World Navigation Hat - Development of a Wearable Navigation Aid using AIoT for the Visually Impaired
### Targets *([ref](https://www.thesavvyscientist.com/thesis-title-examples))*
- **Make it descriptive of the research so it’s immediately obvious what it is about!** - It's a visual sensory substitution device but not much people understand what that means so just use **"Wearable Navigation Aid"**, and although the main feature is it's visual substitution mostly use full for the full blind, it additionally incorporates other visual independent assists which can be useful for people with a variety of visual impairments thus use **"Visually Impaired"**
- **Don’t get lost in the detail** - Our device incorporates multiple methods to achieve the goal such as manual algorithms *(world mapping, emulating senses, priority audio cueing, etc.)*, artificial intellegence *(hand gesture recognition, voice recognition, face recognition, etc.)*, and IoT *(central server for API and automation, world tracking through sensors like GPS, IMU, etc.)*. To summarize the whole process we will just use **"AIoT"** to summerize/generalize the whole process
- **The title should tie together the chapters of your thesis** - The thesis will primarly be about the creation and testing of this device thus use **"Development"**, however since our thesis is a prototype mainly focusing on the hardware and software aspect to solve the issue the final prototype will be bulky to be worn has an eyewear so the paper will be taking into account the device has a hat instead to put all of that load in the head instead of sensitive areas like eyes and ears, thus use **"Hat"**
- **Be strategic** - The main feature of our thesis, is to solve the inequality the visually impared faces when they participate in society, such has navigating the physical world *(going from one place to another especially if the infastructure is not designed for them in mind)*, and the digital world *(social media, internet, etc.)* thus use **"World Navigation"**

## Background of the Study
### Targets *([ref](https://www.enago.com/academy/what-is-background-in-a-research-paper))*
1. **Provide background information** - The background of the study must contain the following to provide enough background information on what this paper will be talking about
   - Provide the statistical information about the number of people affected with the variety of visual impairments in a global, national, and regional scale
   - Provide the description of what a Sensory Substitution Device are in helping the visually impared and they current issue
1. **Identify Your Audience** - Our audience in reading the paper includes students, teachers, and reviewers so we will discuss the project in technical detail
2. **Understand the Research Problem** - The research aims to solve the issues faced by current Sensory Substitution Devices primarily Cognitive overload and limited gneralization beyond labs
3. **Review Existing Literature** - Existing literature
4. **Include Historical Data**
5. **Identify Controversies and Gaps**
6. **Select Key Components**
7. **Craft a Logical Flow**
8. **Hightlight the Novelty of Your Research**

## Rationale
Our approach is justified to forward the progress of sensory substitution devices and attempt to see if we could overcome the issues they faced in societal wide implementation. Our unique approach is to implement three major solutions with a design decision:
- **Virtual worlds** that keep track of the Physical and Digital world allowing the user to navigate not just the physical world but the internet, social media, offline files, etc.
- **Emulation of Human Sensory Processes** to create a more intuitive and less cognitive overloading or sensory fatigue system for users to view the world in
- ***Modularity system** connected into a IoT server, has there are different kinds of visual impairments and everyone have different needs or preferences thus the system must allow customization for each individual which is done through the implementation of Applications
- **Hat** has a prototype is bound to be bulky which can be temporarily solved by putting weight on the head rather then more sensitive areas like eyes or ears until we could compress it into an eyewear



Background of Study
- State how visual imparement
Explain visual sensory substitution and its relevance to the visually impaired, discuss its relevance to School, Regional, National, and international interest through data and sources

Problem Statement
- Explain in detail the issues of
  - the visually impaired or the blind navigating the world without clear sight with their options
  - being limited in detail (white canes, guide dogs, etc.)
  - gap in advance solutions (smart devices, sensory substitution devices, etc.)
  - how existing sensory substitution device have problems with generalization beyond labs, user comfort and ergonomics, cognitive overload, training and intuitiveness, and processing constraints of sensory system
